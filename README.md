# CIFAR10-kNN-with-SVD

This a kNN classifier with 26% accuracy. It works on Jupyter Notebook. 

Because of the Singular Value Decomposition it has such a low accuracy. I think it would have better accuracy with images larger than 32 by 32. 

Feel free the ask questions about the code. You can also ask through my email: kayicomert@gmail.com 

I am a beginner in Machine Learning. If you see anything to correct in the code please notify me.
